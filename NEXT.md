Do small group screen sharing for intermediate feedback

## Organization

- have a rubric for the presentations also

## Indeterminacy

still might need something more. use i in the loops?

actually, maybe it's all about _range_ in the loop. start at x, go to y, skip by whatever
...but this is good at creating regular structures (without other math), not structuring random. or?

it's still indeterminacy, but structured
INDETERMINACY (AND REGULARITY)
DIFFERENCE AND REPETITION is better
can maybe emphasize in the same text the aspects that are kept constrained
but still more examples for repetition would be needed

results were good. but pushing on i would be helpful.
so keep it as indeterminacy. it's a better word. but expand on loops. ignore range, they can do math on i in the code. not a perfect approach, but good for a next iteration.  

--> add past examples


### Nonlinearity

will have to modify to indicate that we've already seen variables (or at least i) earlier

"map" threw some people off. it's really a diagram of all the interaction.

explicitly outlaw yes/no questions


### Recombination

train flip board

add Listening Post to examples

add Cento form!

John Cayley!

closed captions and .srt example

https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017

splitlines() is redundant with split(), so keep the latter to be consistent

karaoke example

--> have in class poetry reading

etheree poem   as example

textwrap() import function

/

having the template was a pain in the ass for file management. not worth it. no one used rhyme.

is there a library already that can be used?

is there not an English dictionary with syllable number in existence? that's not nltk?
https://pypi.org/project/Vocabulary/

if not, do it without. maybe more on analysis, look more closely at Listening Post.

### Interface

a perceptual explanation of framerate etc seems useful -- animation, human perception

how the hell are they going to try each other's interfaces?

a text example, a la maeda, and add text functions to cheat sheet

lerpColor

use mouseReleased
rather than mouseClicked

all their buttons were terrible, so we need a better example of button interfaces (maybe Audrey's instrument from the first addition)

[
focus on the brushes as much as possible.

the internal variable is confusing. switch it to a number. mode = 4
]

focuses on mouse interaction rather than buttons. duet.

### Emergence

exercise:
wrap and bounce
emergence is get() pixel based


###

missing map

apparently globals can be declared inside setup. that makes a big difference for clarity.


## General

Maybe there is an "elaboration" section for each of these. So for nonlinearity, it's using variables to carry objects.

separate the assignment from the tutorial

functions that return things

have the cheat sheet link to sections in the tutorials

I want it to click in terms of programming, but have to be ok if it doesn't for everyone. but the problem-solving aspect should be a part of it, that's what's missing for them, the mentality of making it work.

table crits where I give actual individual feedback, just not in front of the room

for each assignment, there is a problem-solving aspect.
