## Crit format

_Everyone explains title + concept + where they are at, up front_

_Everyone pair off (including me), and play each other's narratives_
- one positive aspect of the work
- one aspect that you think could be improved
--> it's hard to receive criticism, and even harder to give it, but this is practice
_Repeat 5 times_

_Group reflection_

Turn in: change narrative/index/example to a text (.txt) file, and send to me


_5 minute break if necessary_


## Intro to HTML

- Make a folder, somewhere on your computer, and call it "homepage".
- Drag that empty folder to Atom
- open Atom, make a new file, call it `index.html`, and save it in the folder. then close it

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is my webpage
</body>
</html>
```

Now open the file in a browser -- first website!

----> this is the procedure. you edit the file, then you reload the browser.

```
<html>
<head>
    <title>This text shows in the title bar</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a big heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph. <b>This is a bold sentence inside the paragraph.</b></p>
    <p>The following word is in italics: <i>word</i></p>
    <br />
    <img src="http://media.oregonlive.com/pets_impact/photo/14221164-large.jpg" />
    <br />
    <a href="https://www.lclark.edu">This is a link to Lewis and Clark College</a>
    <br />
    <a href="page2.html">This is a link to another custom webpage.</a>    
</body>
</html>

what's the "hyper" part of hypertext?

<a href="http://lclark.edu"></a> -- what's a URL?
then change it to "page2.html"
make a page 2
