# Sketch #8: Magic Mirror

Create a Magic Mirror that augments or replaces a person’s digital “reflection” with additional information or graphics.

Download [this template](08_magic_mirror.zip) to begin, which includes the [clmtracker library](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) to identify the coordinates of key facial features. Incorporate these coordinates into abstract animation or use them as anchors for text or external images.

Your mirror should in some way address the relationship between our physical and digital identities.
