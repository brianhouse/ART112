# Final Project

Your final project is open-ended; it may draw from any of the themes and programming techniques that we have learned this semester. It may be made for presentation online (either for viewing on a computer or a mobile device), as a video which can be projected or displayed on a monitor, or in some other form, pending instructor approval.

You must articulate your intent in a proposal, which should include three elements:
- Concept: a written description (\~200 words) stating what you want to do and why, and any images / sketches / prototypes / models that will help articulate your vision
- Context: Several references to other artists, in any genre, with whom your work will be in dialogue
- Construction: an outline of your technical approach, highlighting any aspects that you will need to learn
<!-- - Display: what you will need to show your work -->

Your proposal should be in the form of slides which you will present to the class.
