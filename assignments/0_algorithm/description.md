# Sketch #0: Algorithm

Make a drawing. Keep it simple and take only two minutes to do it. It can be abstract or figurative.

Now write step by step instructions (a "score") that when followed will result in this drawing.

Give the instructions to someone else and have them follow them to make a new drawing.

Display the two drawings together.
