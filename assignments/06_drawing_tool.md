# Sketch #6: Drawing Tool

Create a software drawing tool using p5. Similar to [MacPaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint), the "user" should be able to choose from multiple tools such as a pencil, eraser, and various brushes, and use them to draw on the open canvas. This will require using p5's [mouse functions](https://p5js.org/examples/input-mouse-functions.html) to keep track of the user's actions. Get creative with the brushstrokesâ€”incorporate what you have learned from your screensaver.
