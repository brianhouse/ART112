0 is the getting started and an online intro
1 is algorithm


## Indeterminacy

too easy? could use some additional structural element; previously asked students to observe and approximate some phenomenon in nature. put that back, maybe:
One approach that you might take for working on the Indeterminacy sketch is to look for inspiration in complex textures from natureâ€”can you use loops+random to make an abstract interpretation of, for example, a pond with ripples and vegetation? clouds and a rainstorm? a forest? fire? insects?

/

still might need something more. use i in the loops?

actually, maybe it's all about _range_ in the loop. start at x, go to y, skip by whatever
...but this is good at creating regular structures (without other math), not structuring random. or?

it's still indeterminacy, but structured
INDETERMINACY (AND REGULARITY)
DIFFERENCE AND REPETITION is better
can maybe emphasize in the same text the aspects that are kept constrained
but still more examples for repetition would be needed

results were good. but pushing on i would be helpful.
so keep it as indeterminacy. it's a better word. but expand on loops. ignore range, they can do math on i in the code. not a perfect approach, but good for a next iteration.  

--> add past examples


## Nonlinearity

will have to modify to indicate that we've already seen variables (or at least i) earlier

"map" through some people off. it's really a diagram of all the interaction.

explicitly outlaw yes/no questions

## Recombination

train flip board

add Listening Post to examples

##

Maybe there is an "elaboration" section for each of these. So for nonlinearity, it's using variables to carry objects.


##


interactivity -> interface, because nonlinearity is also interactive, pues


##

have them read the intro/tutorial prior to class

then class discuss the artistic examples, review the code, and do exercises

separate the assignment from the tutorial

##

functions that return things


have the cheat sheet link to sections in the tutorials


## omissions

islamic art?
