## Units
- Concept
- Context
    - Non-digital art history
    - Digital art history    
- Code (Craft)
    - refs
    - examples
- the sketch

## Class session rotation
- Introduce a new unit
    - follow the material
    - work out examples in realtime
    - students jump in on the chat with questions
    - they'll look at the assignment page afterwards (it's scheduled to appear right after (or during?) class)
- Student presentations followed by ad lib help and examples during work time
- Preliminary crit (5min/student max) followed by ad lib help and examples during work time
    - everyone presents via screen sharing in small groups
    - _think of how you'll change what you're doing in response to feedback_
- Final crit (5min/student max) and we're out
    - everyone presents via screen sharing, comments over chat (which I save)
- Follow the syllabus for small exceptions / intros


## Todo
- in-class exercise for each programming topic
- fill out all units
- cheat sheet for Python Mode

Interface, emergence, and (maybe) glitch are the only assignments that are animated. so at that point, will have to figure out image sequence saving. actually, it doesn't matter for interfaceâ€”can just have the result. so really, emergence is the only one, and that actually fits pedagogically. great.

#### discussion

should there be a physical assignment with everything? there was for algorithm, which counts as belonging to coordinates


for nonlinear, it's the map. but that's really complementary.

I could make them do a "random" physical artwork, too.

eventually, it feels contrived.

these latter half demand a more conceptual approach; a tactical media approach.

the rest is (just) playing with culture, which is absolutely legit, but a different idea of media. right? or do all of these get transcended in some way by culture jamming, to use an old term?
