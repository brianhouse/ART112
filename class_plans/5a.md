## Coordinates

_bring up assignment page_

### Set up p5

- New folder (landscape)
- `index.html`, copy from assignment page
- _go over new tags, `div` and `script`_
- `sketch.js`, copy from assignment page

From now on, let's use Google Chrome


### Discussion

COORDINATES!
- what is a pixel?
- what is a grid?

[show 8th-grade image]
(cultural touch points of the grid: Descartes, modernism)
- is the world organized in a grid?
- did LOGO use a grid?


### Basic coordinates

point(x, y)

line(0, 0, 640, 480) -- what happens?
line(0, 480, 640, 0) -- what happens?

rect(0, 0, 640, 480)

ellipse(200, 150, 50, 50)

line _function_, and the _parameters_ for that function

_use p5js.org to look up the function parameters_


### Change the parameters of the lines

strokeWeight(5) -- in pixels
rect(20, 20, 100, 100)
strokeWeight(10)
rect(200, 200, 50, 50)

### Colors

Can someone tell me about color theory?
R, G, B
255 (2^8)

fill()
stroke()
transparency example with two colors


## Debugging

_make a mistake on purpose and debug it using the console_
