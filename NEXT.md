## Organization

- have a rubric for the presentations also

### Recombination


closed captions and .srt example

https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017

karaoke example

--> have in class poetry reading

etheree poem   as example

textwrap() import function

/

having the template was a pain in the ass for file management. not worth it. no one used rhyme.

is there a library already that can be used?

is there not an English dictionary with syllable number in existence? that's not nltk?
https://pypi.org/project/Vocabulary/

if not, do it without. maybe more on analysis, look more closely at Listening Post.

/////

- add Cento form to non-digital intro
- keep the beginning, but just make it a lesson on indexes, and use shuffle
- fix word replacement to just use concatenation
- then we have:
    - concatenative with word lists
    - cut-ups with a corpus
    - syllables

what's the assignment? do anything?
or pick a form of poetry and a source text and make it work (that would require rhyme)

the rhyme is too shitty. too obscure.

also, wonder if I should go back to terminal for this.


### Interface

a perceptual explanation of framerate etc seems useful -- animation, human perception

how the hell are they going to try each other's interfaces?

a text example, a la maeda, and add text functions to cheat sheet

lerpColor

use mouseReleased
rather than mouseClicked

all their buttons were terrible, so we need a better example of button interfaces (maybe Audrey's instrument from the first addition)

[
focus on the brushes as much as possible.

the internal variable is confusing. switch it to a number. mode = 4
]

focuses on mouse interaction rather than buttons. duet.

### Emergence

exercise:
wrap and bounce
emergence is get() pixel based


###

missing map

apparently globals can be declared inside setup. that makes a big difference for clarity.


## General

Maybe there is an "elaboration" section for each of these. So for nonlinearity, it's using variables to carry objects.

functions that return things

have the cheat sheet link to sections in the tutorials

I want it to click in terms of programming, but have to be ok if it doesn't for everyone. but the problem-solving aspect should be a part of it, that's what's missing for them, the mentality of making it work.

table crits where I give actual individual feedback, just not in front of the room

for each assignment, there is a problem-solving aspect.
