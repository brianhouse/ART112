## Crit (2hr)

_Everyone pair off, and use each other's interfaces_
- one positive aspect of the work
- one aspect that you think could be improved
--> it's hard to receive criticism, and even harder to give it, but this is practice
_Repeat 5 times_ (2hrs)

_Group reflection_

- What are some ways people might change their interfaces after seeing other people use them?


## New code

```js
circle(200, 200, 50)
//
    let x = 200
    let y = 200
    let diameter = 50
    circle(x, y, diameter)

// then put variables up top

//make it move by adding:
x += 1
// take background off

//first with a number, then
let vx = 5

// change direction
vx = -5

// wrap?
// make it bounce? --> you'll change vx, not x

//what if we want more than one ball?

//// ! put all that aside (comment out) for now, and then switch to the object syntax stuff

```
