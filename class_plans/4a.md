## Crit (2hr)

_Everyone explains title + concept + where they are at, from their seats_

_Everyone pair off, and play each other's narratives_
- one positive aspect of the work
- one aspect that you think could be improved
--> it's hard to receive criticism, and even harder to give it, but this is practice
_Repeat 5 times_ (2hrs)

_Group reflection_

- What are some ways people might change their narratives after seeing other people play them?

Turn in: change narrative/index/example to a text (.txt) file, and send to me



## Intro to HTML (1hr)

- Make a folder, somewhere on your computer, and call it "homepage".
- Drag that empty folder to Atom
- open Atom, make a new file, call it `index.html`, and save it in the folder. then close it

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is my webpage
</body>
</html>
```

Now open the file in a browser -- first website!

----> this is the procedure. you edit the file, then you reload the browser.

_show more stuff_

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>This text shows in the title bar</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a big heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph. <b>This is a bold sentence inside the paragraph.</b></p>
    <p>The following word is in italics: <i>word</i></p>
    <p><font color="red" size="32" face="monospace">This text is styled</font></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Look at the address bar. How is this URL different from others?
