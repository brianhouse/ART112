# Sketch #2: Nonlinear Narrative

When we watch TV or read a book, the story usually progresses in a linear way, from start to finish. But in life, the decisions we make affect the choices that are available to us. Digital Media allow for something in the middle: multiple stories can be told by providing points where the narrative branches.

With this sketch, you will create a text-based, nonlinear narrative where the reader/interactor chooses their path by inputting text. Your program must demonstrate at least 5 different branching points; you may also want to have objects that can be "carried" and which have an effect on the narrative.

While your work may be structurally similar to _Zork_, the content should reflect your own artistic concept. Review the links below for inspiration. You must articulate your concept with a title and 3-sentence artist statement that will serve as an introduction.
