# Sketch #5: Generative Screensaver

Create a animation in p5 that continually changes but never exactly repeats. Make use of the `random()` function to achieve this. Your screensaver should convey a compelling sense of complexity that makes us want to watch it unfold.

Your piece should be hosted on githubâ€”email a working URL to the professor before class.
