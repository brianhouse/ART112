## Sketch #4: Recombination

This sketch will consist of a language machine that outputs variations of some sort of structured text via recombination. The exact form that it takes is up to you. You might take a form of poetry, such as a sonnet or free verse, and create variations by using random words from the provided lists or ones you curate. You could also remix a famous art manifesto or political statement, rewrite a newspaper article with substituted words, auto-generate rap lyrics, or produce alternative closed captions for a film. Challenge yourself to produce a novel algorithm that doesn't replicate the examples.

Along with your code and [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md), you should supply three versions of your text output (that result from identical code!) so we can see the nature of the variation that your program produces. Resist the urge to edit the output to smooth over rough edges; looking back, those often become the most interesting features.



Take a source text and modify it in some interesting way.



- extract parts of speech into separate lists
- replace occurrences of some word with another (list or string?)


newspaper article, closed caption, book
