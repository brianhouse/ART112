## Work time

Go around and give three words of a topic for a text-based nonlinear narrative that you are thinking of making.

When you design this, I want you to make a map. On paper. That might be a map that literally represents geography, or it might be a map of the possibilities in a conversation.

_do this using the overhead_
_label squares in a map with a function name() and use lines to connect them with responses_
