# Indeterminacy

## Concept

The physical world is very complex—so much so that it is never fully predictable. From the shape of a leaf to the gait of an animal to the words you use to express a thought, variation is intrinsic to reality. This is intuitive to artmaking in physical mediums. When a paintbrush flows against a canvas, the individual hairs move in a way that creates texture; when musicians play a score, the air responds dynamically to create rich timbres.

Digital media, however, encode everything in numbers. As we saw in the last unit, this can entail defining everything very precisely, rather than intuitively relying on the indeterminate properties of the medium. But to manually reproduce the degree of variation we see in nature would be tedious, if not impossible.

However, algorithms have been developed to simulate "random"—e.g. unpredictable—numbers. Such indeterminacy can be used to create variation that simulates the dynamics of the physical world, or at least expands the possibilities of what can be automatically generated in digital representations.


## Context

### Non-digital

Algorithms for working with indeterminacy have been an important part of artmaking even without electronic computers. The [Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) movement, for example, developed the "chance collage" technique, in which artists dropped scraps of paper onto a larger sheet and pasted them wherever they landed. This method of embracing chance was a reaction against the ideologies of power and control that had led to the outbreak of WWI in Europe in the late 1910s.

In the United States, the term "indeterminacy" is often associated with the composer and conceptual artist John Cage (1912–1992). His piece _Music of Changes_ (1951) arranged notes and rests on a score according to an elaborate system of chance that involved throwing sticks on the ground and interpreting how they landed. He appropriated this technique from the _I Ching_, an ancient Chinese text (1000–750 BCE) which intended it as a means of [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination). This is similar to using tarot cards, rolling dice, or flipping a coin, all of which are manifestations of chance in culture that have been used by artists to generate indeterminacy.

Of course, incorporating nonhuman agency is another way of relinquishing a degree of control over a finished result. Daniel Ranalli did this with snails:

### Digital

When it comes to computers, one way of generating random numbers is to measure some chaotic physical phenomena, like cosmic background radiation, and incorporate those numbers into a program, whether directly or via copying them from a published reference like [_A Million Random Digits_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvLD54GnOTk). A more clever way is using an algorithm called a "pseudo-random number generator" that takes a "seed" (like the current time) and [elaborates upon it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister). The resulting numbers are not strictly indeterminate as it is possible to predict them, but for most purposes they are more than good enough. Most programming languages include a function, usually called `random`, that lets us use these numbers.

Digital media artists have seized upon the opportunity.
