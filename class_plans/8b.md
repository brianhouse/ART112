so, right now we have to switch back and forth this variable to pick which one

what if we wanted to apply it to both?

there's two things we can use so we don't have to rewrite

- make an array (do an aside, with different things in the array)
- make a for loop (do an aside, with just printing)
```js
let my_list = [1, 2, 3, "bananas"]
for (let item of my_list) {
    print(item)
}
```

(point out how color is list)


next step, do it with random, and push, in setup


//

--> need other types of motion


//

future: dynamically creating objects
