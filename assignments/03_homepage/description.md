# Sketch #3: Personal Home Page

The World Wide Web brought the internet to the mainstream. While today social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter dominate what happens online, websites were originally made by individuals who hand-coded their "personal home pages" using HTML (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage)**

For this sketch, you will use HTML to design a personal home page for your Digital Media I artist persona. This page will serve as a portfolio for the remaining sketches that you will do in this class. For our purposes, you are not limited to a "professional" or contemporary aesthetic; in the spirit of the early web, you are encouraged to make a playful or experimental site using the basic HTML functionality.

Turn in your sketch by emailing a working home page URL to the instructor by next Tuesday. We will not be critiquing this work in class.


## Technical preparation

To do this you will need set up hosting using GitHub.
- create an account on [GitHub](http://github.com/) if you don't have one already
- create a new "repository," and call it `USERNAME.github.io` where USERNAME is the name you have used for your GitHub account; make the repository public, and be sure to check the option `Initialize this repository with a README`
- navigate to the `Settings` menu of the repository, and find the section titled `GitHub Pages`; under `source`, choose `master branch`

Your website will now be viewable in your web browser at the following URL, where USERNAME is replaced with the name of your GitHub account: http://USERNAME.github.io

When you have created an `index.html` file, upload it to your repository.



## HTML example

Copy and paste this html into a file ending in `index.html` and view it in a web browser:
```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>This text shows in the title bar</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="lightblue" leftmargin="400">

    <h1>This is a big heading</h1>

    <h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>

    <p>This is a paragraph. <b>This is a bold sentence inside the paragraph.</b></p>

    <p>The following word is in italics: <i>word</i></p>

    <center><p>This paragraph is centered</p></center>

    <br /> <!-- this is a comment pointing out the blank line made by the <br /> tag

    <hr /> <!-- this is a horizontal line -->

    <p><font color="red" size="32" face="monospace">This text is styled</font></p>        

    <img width="200" src="http://media.oregonlive.com/pets_impact/photo/14221164-large.jpg" /> <!-- this is an image of Pio -->

    <br />

    <a href="https://www.lclark.edu">This is a link to Lewis and Clark College</a>

    <br />

    <a href="page2.html">This is a link to another custom webpage.</a>    

</body>
</html>
```

While looking online for HTML resources, you'll often find references to CSS. In general, contemporary web pages use HTML for structure and CSS for the layout and appearance. We won't be going over CSS in class, and it is not a requirement to use it, but you can if you want.
