## Sketch #3: Nonlinearity

Create a nonlinear narrative in the second person using code where the reader chooses their path by inputting text. While your work may be structurally similar to _Zork_, the theme and written content should reflect your own artistic concept. Your program must demonstrate at least 8 different branching points that create meaningful alternative paths.

Asking the reader "yes" / "no" questions is officially outlawed, as are prompts that are similar to "Do you want to continue?" as these do not provide true branching points. There must be more than one way to meaningfully traverse through your narrative.

Draw a "map" of the the choices that will be available to your reader (by hand, using Google Draw, or any other medium). Every "room" in your map should correspond to a function in your code. You should have little, if any, code outside of a function.

Turn in your map along with your final Python code to Google Classroom. In addition, upload a document that includes your title and a [3-sentence description](../../resources/description_guidelines.md) that explains how you'd like us to approach the result.
