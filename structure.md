## Class session rotation
* 1: Introduce a new unit
    - context lecture
    - introduce code and work out examples in realtime
    - in-class exercise of some kind
    - go over assignment

* 2:
    - Artist presentations
    - in-class work and help
    - introduce additional code + tricks

* 3: (skipped for 3s)
    - Artist presentations
    - Table crits
        - everyone presents via screen sharing in small groups
        - get feedback on your concept and aesthetics
        - share your code and show how you've done things
        - help each other
        - think of how you'll change what you're doing in response to feedback    
    - Improvised additional examples

* 4: Crits
    - 5min/student
        - Assignments come in over Google Driveâ€”images must be labeled with your name, a separate google doc with your artist description
        - I do it up front, the student reads their description, get feedback (at least two comments from everyone, and I'm going to coach that. ie: ok, what do people think is particularly strong? what do people think could be improved?)
        - Exceptions
            - Nonlinearity is table crit, playing
            - Recombination is a poetry reading
            - Interface is table crit, playing


Crits won't take the whole class time. So after crits, the lecture for the next section begins, which gets taken up the next class as necessary.
