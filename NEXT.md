## Indeterminacy

too easy? could use some additional structural element; previously asked students to observe and approximate some phenomenon in nature. put that back, maybe.

A final thought from the comments in class today:

One approach that you might take for working on the Indeterminacy sketch is to look for inspiration in complex textures from natureâ€”can you use loops+random to make an abstract interpretation of, for example, a pond with ripples and vegetation? clouds and a rainstorm? a forest? fire? insects?
