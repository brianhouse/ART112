poetry assignment is essentially twitter without the online part
arrays and variables

maybe interface is not so great. they were mostly shit, right? but it's a good discussion.

scrapping turtle logic, personal homepage, machine gaze
adding glitch, network, and recombinant


ok, so the only issue here is that processing.py doesn't take console input. so close, yet so far.


//

the colors in the processing IDE are very helpful
special functions are blue, special variables are pink

python is so much cleaner than js, brackets go away, file management goes away, image loading goes away

...but screen sharing becomes key, and code sharing

philosophical justification here is that a generation z power user approach which gets the dynamics of systems on some level does not get the structural components underneath. but I mean, the cultural interventions Im imagining were not exactly forthcoming from the students in the moment. looking at Everest's class, those are online bootrapped formal things.

NONLINEARITY
- let's have a requirement of a name (string) and an object (boolean, internal)

why is this always a problem? I guess because procedural programming and event loops don't always play nice
...and in this case, the input is an event, so I cant use it out of a loop

Brython uses a dialog box.
pypy.js throws an exception
skulpt uses a dialog box
piodide fails.

so all that fails.

in the ide, can do it, but need to separate display and branching, so it's just not the form I like.

it's not the nice form I like

static mode doesn't work, because it doesn't draw until the end

well, fuck it. all Macs have built in python.
they use the IDE, but drag into the terminal. hell yeah!

fixed it.

how do they try each others?

same way they try everything. which is screen sharing. only time it's interactive is in this version
could also be screen sharing

coordinating pair-ups ... well, breakout groups


--> make sure they have whatever zoom extensions installed they need to have

pyglet is almost there. you could make a wrapper around it that is processing-like.
processing itself, however, does a lot of great file management stuff. would be insane to attempt that now.
but that's the future-proof plan.

so we're just stuck on input, which is so freaking stupid given that it is python to begin with.

generative is both different every time and unanticipated

nonlinearity _could_ be visual
no. same problem with event basis.
