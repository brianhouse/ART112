grade right away

turtle:
- make sure they save a drawing of it to include in the portfolio
- emphasize repeat

nonlinear_narrative:
- use platformio-ide-terminal within atom rather than learning terminal commands
- add an auto-lowercase to the includes? like a function: search(response, "left") or something that avoids dot-syntax
- people tended to create choice narratives rather than spatial ones

personal homepage:
- make more a reflection on identity? media archeology? more context somehow?
- link to friends in the class
- needs to be crit
- should be more explicitly a portfolio. the gifs are cool, but I think I overdid it.
- include the turtle?
- include nonlinear narrative somehow? (that would mean a server)
- maybe grade it at the end of the semester?

- all code can be subdirectories, dont have to do separate repositories

coordinate landscape:
- show 3D? no.

expressive interface:
- don't demonstrate keyboard, they can find that if they want it
- use `brush = 1`, not names

- need artist examples

animate objects
- objects and for loops are tough all at once. wondering if 'for' should be separate and earlier somehow

--> emphasize blocks -- building blocks of code

/

Lynn Hershman Leeson and Alison Parrish are hard examples to make compelling presentations on


/

get rid of the 0 in front of the assignment numbers

/

need to teach how to steal more

and more examples!

should you use the online IDE? in some ways it's great
in other ways, using a text editor is so key

reading prompts. I mean, "Machine Gaze" has some obvious literature to go with it
