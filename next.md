grade right away

turtle:
- make sure they save a drawing of it to include in the portfolio

nonlinear_narrative:
- use platformio-ide-terminal within atom rather than learning terminal commands
- add an auto-lowercase to the includes? like a function: search(response, "left") or something that avoids dot-syntax
- people tended to create choice narratives rather than spatial ones

personal homepage:
- make more a reflection on identity? media archeology? more context somehow?
- link to friends in the class
- needs to be crit
- should be more explicitly a portfolio. the gifs are cool, but I think I overdid it.
- include the turtle?
- include nonlinear narrative somehow? (that would mean a server)
- maybe grade it at the end of the semester?

- all code can be subdirectories, dont have to do separate repositories

coordinate landscape:
- show 3D?

expressive interface:
- don't demonstrate keyboard, they can find that if they want it
- use `brush = 1`, not names

- need artist examples

the plan here is to use objects together with animation from the get-go
meaning relative coordinates

and not classes, but {} syntax
so that animation class is big. if they get that, that's it, they're programmers.

should this be object oriented from the get go? ie, what about interface using objects?


--> emphasize blocks -- building blocks of code

Lynn Hershman Leeson and Alison Parrish are hard examples to make compelling presentations on
