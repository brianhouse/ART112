nonlinear_narrative:
- use platformio-ide-terminal within atom rather than learning terminal commands
- add an auto-lowercase to the includes? like a function: search(response, "left") or something that avoids dot-syntax
- people tended to create choice narratives rather than spatial ones

personal homepage:
- make more a reflection on identity? media archeology? more context somehow?
- link to friends in the class
