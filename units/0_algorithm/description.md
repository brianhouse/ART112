# Sketch #0: Algorithm

_Make a drawing. Keep it simple and take only two minutes to do it. It can be abstract or figurative.

Now write step by step instructions (a "score") that when followed will result in this drawing.

Give the instructions to someone else and have them follow them to make a new drawing.

Display the two drawings together._

## Intro

Welcome to Digital Media I

First, what this course is _not_: we are not going to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, Video editing, or audio workstations. Mastering software like that is a legitimate take on what Digital Media is, and I apologize if that's what anyone is looking for.

...but what we are going to do in this course is to make art by programming a computer.

In the computer science department, your learn to program by solving problems. Here, you'll learn to code by making up your own problems, or more generally, the problem is how to express yourselves by telling the computer what to do.

That's what code is—an organized set of instructions given to the computer to produce a desired outcome. There's a fancy word we use for that: algorithm.

Are algorithms always on the computer? What are other examples? *[musical score, blueprints, IKEA, Legos...]*

A recipe is really a beautiful example of an algorithm, and it's a lot like code. You have a set of specialized terms, like "tablespoon" and "mince", and it involves all kinds of technological equipment.

How do you come up with a recipe?
- experimentation, trial-and-error
- cookbook
- family recipes
- remixing

That's exactly how I want you to think about code. You're always borrowing code, using libraries, looking stuff up, and it's lots and lots and lots of trial and error.

So where does that get us? What's possible with code? Here are some more or less random examples of artists making things with code:
- [Chris Milk](http://milk.co/treachery)
- [Nicole Aptekar](https://www.instagram.com/nicole.aptekar/)
- [Mario Klingemann](https://www.flickr.com/photos/quasimondo/albums/72157677689800878)
- [Brenna Murphy](https://upforgallery.com/central-lattice-tool-array)
- [Onyx Ashanti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JataQs4R5Bc&feature=youtu.be&t=1031)

What do you think about these examples?

How about this one?
- [Sol Lewitt](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnMOGrbPkAhWFlp4KHc0RA9gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1280&bih=677)

These are pieces by Sol Lewitt, who is a major figure in the so-called Western canon. But here's the thing. Sol didn't actually paint these. He just provided the [instructions](lewitt.pdf).

Lewitt was doing this in the 60s. What else was happening in the 60s? Well, computers, which had been invented in the modern sense in the 40s, were diffusion of computation into the cultural consciousness.

This idea that we can make things happen in the world by defining them in a formal way and letting the results play out.

So let's give it a shot.


## Exercise

- Take out the drawing you made
- Get an index card
- On the card I want you to write, in words, a series of instructions that, when followed by someone else, will result in the drawing
...
- Now we're going to swap
- When you're done, put the original, the code, and the re-interpretation together

Crit _discuss the differences without revealing identities_

_Follow-up questions_:
- How did it feel to follow the instructions?
- How much was left up to interpretation?


## Syllabus

Today we've been exploring the idea of an **algorithm**. That's fundamental to digital media, and from here on out we'll be writing algorithms using code—specifically, Python from within a programming environment called Processing.

There are several other qualities associated with digital media, and in this course we'll deal with **encoding**, **nonlinearity**, **indeterminacy**, **recombination**, **interface**, **emergence**, and **glitch**. For each one of these, I'll introduce the structure, explain how you program it in Pythin, and then you'll complete an artwork, or as we'll call it, a "sketch".

That's more or less it. Please look at the syllabus for policies, how the grading works, and so forth.
