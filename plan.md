ok. so, problems:

- interface, emergence, and (maybe) glitch are the only assignments that are animated. so at that point, will have to figure out image sequence saving. actually, it doesn't matter for interfaceâ€”can just have the result. so really, emergence is the only one, and that actually fits pedagogically. great.
