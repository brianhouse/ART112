- interface, emergence, and (maybe) glitch are the only assignments that are animated. so at that point, will have to figure out image sequence saving. actually, it doesn't matter for interfaceâ€”can just have the result. so really, emergence is the only one, and that actually fits pedagogically. great.


// discussion

should there be a physical assignment with everything? there was for algorithm, which counts as belonging to coordinates


for nonlinear, it's the map. but that's really complementary.

I could make them do a "random" physical artwork, too.

eventually, it feels contrived.
