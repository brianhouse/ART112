## Indeterminacy

too easy? could use some additional structural element; previously asked students to observe and approximate some phenomenon in nature. put that back, maybe.

A final thought from the comments in class today:

One approach that you might take for working on the Indeterminacy sketch is to look for inspiration in complex textures from natureâ€”can you use loops+random to make an abstract interpretation of, for example, a pond with ripples and vegetation? clouds and a rainstorm? a forest? fire? insects?


still might need something more. use i in the loops?

actually, maybe it's all about _range_ in the loop. start at x, go to y, skip by whatever
...but this is good at creating regular structures (without other math), not structuring random. or?
