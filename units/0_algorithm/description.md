<!-- # Algorithm

_Make a drawing. Keep it simple and take only two minutes to do it. It can be abstract or figurative.

Now write step by step instructions (a "score") that when followed will result in this drawing.

Give the instructions to someone else and have them follow them to make a new drawing.

Display the two drawings together._ -->


## Hello

**Take 2min and make a drawing, keep it simple, it can be figurative or abstract, and then set it aside. Put your virtual hand up when you're done.**

Let's go around and see who's here: name/pronouns + year + major


## Intro

Welcome to Digital Media I

First, what this course is _not_: we are not going to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, Video editing, or audio workstations. Mastering software like that is a legitimate take on what Digital Media is, and I apologize if that's what anyone is looking for.

...but what we are going to do in this course is to make art by learning to program a computer.

In the computer science department, you learn to program by solving problems. Here, you'll learn to program by making up your own problems, or more generally, the problem is how to express yourselves by telling the computer what to do (and ultimately learning from the computer what might be interesting to express).

That's what a program is—an organized set of instructions given to the computer to produce some outcome. There's also a fancy (and much older) word we also use for that (what is it?): **algorithm**.

Are algorithms always on the computer? What are other examples besides code? *[musical score, blueprints, IKEA, Legos...]*

A recipe is really a beautiful example of an algorithm, and it's a lot like a computer program. You have a set of specialized terms, like "tablespoon" and "mince", and it involves all kinds of technological equipment.

How do you come up with a recipe?
- experimentation, trial-and-error
- cookbook
- family recipes
- remixing

That's exactly how I want you to think about programming. You're always borrowing _code_—ie, the pieces of a program—using libraries, looking stuff up, and it's lots and lots and lots of trial and error.

So where does that get us? What's possible with programming? Here are some more or less random examples of artists making things out of code:
- [Chris Milk](http://milk.co/treachery)
- [Nicole Aptekar](https://www.instagram.com/nicole.aptekar/)
- [Mario Klingemann](https://www.flickr.com/photos/quasimondo/albums/72157677689800878)
- [Brenna Murphy](https://upforgallery.com/central-lattice-tool-array)
- [Onyx Ashanti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JataQs4R5Bc&feature=youtu.be&t=1031)

What do you think about these examples?

How about this one?
- [Sol Lewitt](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnMOGrbPkAhWFlp4KHc0RA9gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1280&bih=677)

These are pieces by Sol Lewitt, who is a major figure in the so-called Western canon. But here's the thing. Sol didn't actually paint these. He just provided the [instructions](lewitt.pdf).

Lewitt was doing this in the 60s. What else was happening in the 60s? Well, computers, which had been invented in the modern sense in the 40s, were diffusion of computation into the cultural consciousness.

This idea that we can make things happen in the world by defining them in a formal way and letting the results play out.

So let's give it a shot.


## Exercise

<!-- - Take the drawing you made
- Get an index card
- On the card I want you to write, in words, a series of instructions that, when followed by someone else, will result in the drawing
...
- Now we're going to swap
- When you're done, put the original, the code, and the re-interpretation together -->

- This will be a little weird to do remotely, but I'm putting a google doc in the chat now. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sqK5JAdaA9RTPOGJqOtdsOQDT45IsDcHXvrvSTgLecg/edit?usp=sharing
- I'd like everyone to find some space on it somewhere, and to write, in words, a series of instructions that, when followed by someone else, will result in the drawing.
- don't put your name on it; I know Google Docs will log it anyway
...
- So now, we're going to swap.
- Use whatever set of instructions is below the ones you wrote. If yours is last, use the first one. Does that make sense?
- Follow the instructions to draw the drawing
...
_student shows the reinterpretation_
- How did it feel to follow the instructions?
- How much was left up to interpretation?
_author shows the original_
- Would you approach things differently now?



## Syllabus

From here on out, we're going to continue to write **algorithms**, but they will be for a computer instead of a human. As humans, we intuitively rely on a common context to understand what is being said to us. Lacking this, a computer depends on us to use an unambiguous formal language that it knows how to interpret. That is what a programming language is.

There are many programming languages out there, but in this course we are going to use Python from within the Processing Environment. In fact, your homework for next time is to download that and get it running—there are [instructions](getting_started.md) on how to do that on Google Classroom.

In addition to **algorithm** are several other qualities associated with digital media, and in this course we'll deal with **encoding**, **nonlinearity**, **indeterminacy**, **recombination**, **interface**, **emergence**, and **glitch**. For each one of these, I'll introduce the structure, show some of the context within art history, explain how you program it in Python, and then you'll complete an artwork (or as we'll call it, a "sketch").

And that is it in a nutshell. The only additional component is that once over the course of the semester, each one of you will give a short presentation about a digital media artist. The idea there is that we get a sense of some of the breadth of practices that are out there. We'll have a couple of those each week, and it may or may not line up with what we're working on that week, but that's ok. You can sign up for presentations on Google Classroom, it's first come first served, so check that out.

In fact, everything is up on Google Classroom, and we'll be leaning on that heavily to administer the course, so please take some time to be familiar with that. From here on out, I'll do all my communication through the Stream (do people get emails when I post?)

Please look at the syllabus in particular for policies, how the grading works, and so forth.

What questions do you have for me now?

I'd like everyone to fill out a questionnaire if they haven't already.

Your homework for Thursday is on Classroom, which is to get set up with Python Mode for Processing. If you have problems getting that going, please email me or comment on the assignment.
