# Sketch #1: Turtle Drawing

For this sketch, you will use an online [LOGO interpreter](https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/) (ignore the reference material on the right side of the window). With LOGO, you give instructions to a "turtle" who draws on the screen. Examples of common LOGO instructions are:

- `fd 100`    Move forward 100 steps
- `rt 90`     Turn to the right 90ยบ
- `lt 90`     Turn to the left 90ยบ
- `bk 100`    Move backwards 100 steps
- `pu`        Pull the "pen up" off the paper
- `pd`        Put the pen down" on the paper
- `cs`        Clear the screen and start over
  
- `repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]`   Repeat the instructions enclosed in brackets four times (makes a square)
- `repeat 20 [repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90] rt 18]`   Repeat the repeated instructions...


Part 1:

To get the hang of LOGO, have the turtle

- draw a square
- draw a triangle
- draw a circle (possible?)


Part 2:

Now revisit your instructions from last week. Translate your original written instructions into LOGO as well as you are able. Think about what is straightforward to write in code and what is not.

Save a screenshot of your result that includes the turtle instructions.


Part 3:

Draw with the turtle however you would like. Save a screenshot of your result, which you will share with the class (we are not expecting a masterpiece).
