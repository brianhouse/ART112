## Crit (2hr)

_Everyone pair off, and use each other's interfaces_
- one positive aspect of the work
- one aspect that you think could be improved
--> it's hard to receive criticism, and even harder to give it, but this is practice
_Repeat 5 times_ (2hrs)

_Group reflection_

- What are some ways people might change their interfaces after seeing other people use them?


## New code

```js
circle(200, 200, 50)
//
    let x = 200
    let y = 200
    let diameter = 50
    circle(x, y, diameter)

// then put variables up top

//make it faster by adding:
x += 1

//first with a number, then
let vx = 5

// change direction
vx = -5

// make it bounce?

// get the edges right
// make the window small
// add gravity?
vx -= .1
// make it wrap instead
// take background off

//what if we want more than one ball?
//(there's no point in introducing "this" without classes. keep functions out of the properties)

ball1 = {x: 200, y: 200, vx: 1, vy: 1, size: 60, color: [255, 100, 255]}

let balls = [ball1, ball2]
for (let ball of balls) {

}
```
