## Crit (2hr)

_Everyone pair off, and use each other's interfaces_
- one positive aspect of the work
- one aspect that you think could be improved
--> it's hard to receive criticism, and even harder to give it, but this is practice
_Repeat 5 times_ (2hrs)

_Group reflection_

- What are some ways people might change their interfaces after seeing other people use them?
