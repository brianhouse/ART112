# Sketch #3: Web

Use web pages and HTML to create an online nonlinear experience. Each page, of which you should have at least 5, should link to multiple other pages (and may also incorporate outside links). Your work may use text, it may be  image-based, or it may incorporate both. You may choose to adapt your Narrative Maze from the previous assignment to the web, reinterpret an existing story or poem into hypertext, or create something entirely new.

For inspiration, view Olia Lialina's [_My Boyfriend Came Back from the War_](http://www.teleportacia.org/war) (1995), a pioneering internet artwork.  

Your web narrative should be hosted on githubâ€”email a working link to the professor.

    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is my webpage.</p>
</body>
