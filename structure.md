## Class session rotation
* 1: Introduce a new unit
    - context lecture
    - introduce code and work out examples in realtime
    - in-class exercise of some kind
    - go over assignment

* 2:
    - Artist presentations
    - in-class work and help
    - introduce additional code + tricks

* 3: (skipped for 3s)
    - Artist presentations
    - Table crits
        - everyone presents via screen sharing in small groups
        - get feedback on your concept and aesthetics
        - share your code and show how you've done things
        - help each other
        - think of how you'll change what you're doing in response to feedback    
    - Improvised additional examples

* 4: Crits
    - 5min/student max and we're out
        - Assignments come in over Google Drive—images must be labeled with your name, a separate google doc with your artist description
        - I do it up front, the student reads their description, get feedback (at least two comments from everyone, and I'm going to coach that. ie: ok, what do people think is particularly strong? what do people think could be improved?)
        - Exceptions
            - Nonlinearity is table crit, playing
            - Recombination is a poetry reading
            - Interface is table crit, playing


Crits won't take the whole class time. So after crits, the lecture for the next section begins, which gets taken up the next class.



## Todo
- need some way to have text-based slides
    https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/beamer-slides-using-markdown-and-pandoc
    https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides
    the issue is presentation notes
    https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#speaker-notes
    so I generate a ppt and open in keynote? a little roundabout, but works
    advantage being the notes also stay as markdown and can be reviewed online
- in-class exercise for each programming topic
- fill out all units
- cheat sheet for Python Mode
- separate assignment from the lecture


#### submitting video

Interface, emergence, and (maybe) glitch are the only assignments that are animated. so at that point, will have to figure out image sequence saving. actually, it doesn't matter for interface—can just have the result. so really, emergence is the only one, and that actually fits pedagogically. great.

#### discussion

wait, so all of this can be done without events. in non-interactive mode. is that awesome? or no?
