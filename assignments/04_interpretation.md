# Sketch #4: Digital Interpretation

Choose a [famous painting from art history](https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+paintings) and reinterpret it in code using [p5](https://p5js.org). Abstract the original brushstrokes into geometric shapes, but retain a recognizable sense of the original composition. Pay particular attention to the use (or non-use) of color. For full credit, your interpretation will possess an original form distinct from the original.
