grade right away

turtle:
- make sure they save a drawing of it to include in the portfolio
- emphasize repeat

nonlinear_narrative:
- use platformio-ide-terminal within atom rather than learning terminal commands
- add an auto-lowercase to the includes? like a function: search(response, "left") or something that avoids dot-syntax
- people tended to create choice narratives rather than spatial ones

personal homepage:
- make more a reflection on identity? media archeology? more context somehow?
- link to friends in the class
- needs to be crit
- should be more explicitly a portfolio. the gifs are cool, but I think I overdid it.
- include the turtle?
- include nonlinear narrative somehow? (that would mean a server)
- maybe grade it at the end of the semester?

- all code can be subdirectories, dont have to do separate repositories

coordinate landscape:
- show 3D? no.

expressive interface:
- don't demonstrate keyboard, they can find that if they want it
- use `brush = 1`, not names

- need artist examples

animate objects
- objects and for loops are tough all at once. wondering if 'for' should be separate and earlier somehow


didn't learn map!


/

--> emphasize blocks -- building blocks of code

/

Lynn Hershman Leeson and Alison Parrish are hard examples to make compelling presentations on


/

get rid of the 0 in front of the assignment numbers

/

need to teach how to steal more. seriously, like a whole workshop in a class about how to find code examples and snippets and steal them.

each unit should have an artist focus in addition to a list


//


should you use the online IDE? in some ways it's great
in other ways, using a text editor is so key


/


reading prompts. I mean, "Machine Gaze" has some obvious literature to go with it

///

might need more of a puzzle framework; too much adopting examples wholesale

///

eventually, this course has to go. "Algorithmic Aesthetics" would be a better framing: where's the class where they make a score for the whole class to perform? glitch, etc?

I want it to be timeless, and p5 feels so bound. that's really the issue.

* nonlinear narrative is working. be really explicit about variables.
- personal homepage is fine
- coordinate landscape could use something else
- interface is so good in principle. maybe it's all about the brushes?
    - provide the "normative" version, exercise is the alteration (American Artist is the featured example)
* objects + emergence is totally a topic. so maybe the simulator is built, they just have to define the rules.
- machine gaze is good in principle. it could literally be deforming an image they find and putting it on there

if they learn "drawing" in a procedural sense, which is practically logo, but maybe instead of logo, perhaps that's enough.

- video glitch
- network messages, in some simpler way

each one really has to emphasize the off the screen elements.
nonlinear narrative has the drawn map

everyone was totally with me up until the objects, I think

aesthetic "problems":
- recreate Mondrian, etc

//
NONLINEARITY -- narrtive (minor: IF, major: infinite cinema) database as medium
EMERGENCE -- rule-based simulation (minor: CAs, major: flocking etc)
INTERFACE -- variation off the normative
COORDINATE
TRANSCODING
DISTRIBUTION
PLAY

Lev's:
numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and transcoding
--> missing a social or distributed aspect

revisit Carl

this is a software approach, not hardware (DM2 is "hardware")
