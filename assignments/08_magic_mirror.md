# Sketch #8: Magic Mirror

Create a Magic Mirror that augments a person’s digital “reflection” with additional information or graphics. Use [clmtracker](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) library for face tracking or [ml5 PoseNet](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-PoseNet/) library for skeleton tracking to identify the coordinates of key features of the body. Incorporate these coordinates into abstract animation or use them as anchors for text or external images, and overlay these elements on top of a live video feed.
