# Nonlinearity

## Concept

With traditional media, such as film, audio recordings, or books, things proceed in a fixed sequence. Though we can do things like rewind a tape, or  use page numbers to jump to a particular section of a novel, the possibilities are limited because the content is static. When creating this type of artwork, we typically compose a linear narrative (or narratives) that will be followed again and again in the same order.

Digital media, however, do not need to be linear. Because computers can respond in the moment to how a person is experiencing an artwork, the content can be dynamic. Rather than define the exact sequence of a story, for example, we can create a map of possibilities and leave the specific path up to the reader. This quality of nonlinearity is characteristic of narrative- and time-based artwork that does not just reproduce analog forms in digital media, but takes advantage of the possibilities intrinsic to computers.


## Context

### Non-digital

That said, there are analog media that have nonlinear structures without using computers. A classic example of this is the [_Choose Your Own Adventure_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) series of young adult novels. Popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the books are written in the second person so the reader identifies with the protagonist. Every few pages they offer a choice between a few different actions, each of which requires skipping to a different page in the book to continue reading. Choose Your Own Adventure books had up to 44 different endings and prefigured some of the adventure games released on personal computers that were beginning to proliferating at the same time.

Other examples in literature that include aspects of nonlinearity (though not necessarily the mechanism of skipping pages according to reader choices) include James Joyce's [_Ulysses_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)) (1922), Julio Cortázar's [_Hopscotch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_(Cortázar_novel)) (1963), and Kurt Vonnegut's [_Slaughterhouse Five_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five) (1969).

In 1967, film director Radúz Činčera tried something similar with film. His [_Kinoautomat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoautomat), made for the Czechoslovak Pavilion of the World Exposition, included several points in which the action stopped and the audience was polled to determine what should happen next, and the projection was switched between two reels of film accordingly. The film was ultimately banned by the Communist Party.

Although traditional film is ultimately inflexible in its sequence, there are many movies that suggest nonlinearity in their content, usually by telling a story in a different order than that experienced by the characters. These include several by celebrated avant-garde directors such as Jean-Luc Godard's [_Weekend_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_(1967_film)) (1967), Andrei Tartovsky's [_The Mirror_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_(1975_film)) (1975), and Quentin Tarantino's [_Pulp Fiction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_(film)) (1994).

More recently, Netflix created a special episode of Black Mirror, called [_Bandersnatch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch) (2018), which, because it is digital media, was able to incorporate audience choice into the narrative, which self-reflexively referred to the branching narratives of video games.
