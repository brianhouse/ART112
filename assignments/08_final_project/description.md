## Example Code

### Setup for using external images in sketches

Because p5 runs in the browser, and because browsers have security restrictions that prevent it from accessing your files directly, there are a few extra steps if you want to load images directly in a p5 sketch. Specifically, you must run your sketch from a local web server. A "server" is simply a computer that provides access to a folder of files via HTTPâ€”ie, the web. GitHub is already a server, so the following only applies to running your sketch locally. Once you've uploaded it, it should work as expected.

The p5 website outlines [a few ways to run a local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

The easiest is install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/).
