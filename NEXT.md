Do small group screen sharing for intermediate feedback

## Organization

0 is the getting started and an online intro
1 is algorithm


just have indeterminacy and repetition as two distinct units, with one assignment

introduce each on subsequent days


have a different rubric
have a rubric for the presentations also

dont have assignment text in Classroom, so they have to go to the actual site

no late work is accepted


## Units

## Indeterminacy

too easy? could use some additional structural element; previously asked students to observe and approximate some phenomenon in nature. put that back, maybe:
One approach that you might take for working on the Indeterminacy sketch is to look for inspiration in complex textures from natureâ€”can you use loops+random to make an abstract interpretation of, for example, a pond with ripples and vegetation? clouds and a rainstorm? a forest? fire? insects?

/

still might need something more. use i in the loops?

actually, maybe it's all about _range_ in the loop. start at x, go to y, skip by whatever
...but this is good at creating regular structures (without other math), not structuring random. or?

it's still indeterminacy, but structured
INDETERMINACY (AND REGULARITY)
DIFFERENCE AND REPETITION is better
can maybe emphasize in the same text the aspects that are kept constrained
but still more examples for repetition would be needed

results were good. but pushing on i would be helpful.
so keep it as indeterminacy. it's a better word. but expand on loops. ignore range, they can do math on i in the code. not a perfect approach, but good for a next iteration.  

--> add past examples


### Nonlinearity

will have to modify to indicate that we've already seen variables (or at least i) earlier

"map" threw some people off. it's really a diagram of all the interaction.

explicitly outlaw yes/no questions


### Recombination

train flip board

add Listening Post to examples

add Cento form!

John Cayley!

closed captions and .srt example

splitlines() is redundant with split(), so keep the latter to be consistent

karaoke example

--> have in class poetry reading

etheree poem   as example

textwrap() import function


### Interface

a perceptual explanation of framerate etc seems useful -- animation, human perception

how the hell are they going to try each other's interfaces?


### Emergence




###

missing map


## General

Maybe there is an "elaboration" section for each of these. So for nonlinearity, it's using variables to carry objects.

have them read the intro/tutorial prior to class
then class discuss the artistic examples, review the code, and do exercises

separate the assignment from the tutorial

functions that return things

have the cheat sheet link to sections in the tutorials

new grading structure based on Allisons? can extrapolate beyond the examples be part of it?

I want it to click in terms of programming, but have to be ok if it doesn't for everyone. but the problem-solving aspect should be a part of it, that's what's missing for them, the mentality of making it work.

why are they so bad at file management. it's google's fault.
