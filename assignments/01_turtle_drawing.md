# Sketch #1: Turtle Drawing Still Life

For this sketch, you will use an online [LOGO interpreter](https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/) (ignore the reference material on the right side of the window). With LOGO, you give instructions to a "turtle" who draws on the screen. The core LOGO instructions are:
- `fd 100`    Move forward 100 steps
- `rt 90`     Turn to the right 90ยบ
- `lt 90`     Turn to the left 90ยบ
- `bk 100`    Move backwards 100 steps
- `pu`        Pull the "pen up" off the paper
- `pd`        Put the pen down" on the paper
- `cs`        Clear the screen and start over
- `repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]`   Repeat the instructions enclosed in brackets four times (makes a square)
- `repeat 20 [repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90] rt 18]`   Repeat the repeated instructions...


To get the hang of LOGO, have the turtle
- draw a square
- draw a triangle
- draw a circle (possible?)


Now have the turtle draw a still life from the model in the room.

Email your finished (or unfinished) code to the instructor along with a screenshot of your result.
