## Hello

**Take 2min and make a drawing, keep it simple, it can be figurative or abstract**

Let's go around and see who's here: name/pronouns + year + major  


## Intro

Welcome to Digital Media I

First, what this course is _not_: we are not going to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, Video editing, or DAWs. Those are all legitimate takes on Digital Media, and I apologize if that's what anyone is looking for.

What we _are_ going to do is make art by programming a computer.

In the computer science department, your learn to program by solving problems. Here, you'll learn to code by making up your own problems, or more generally, the problem is how to express yourselves by telling the computer what to do.

That's what code isâ€”an organized set of instructions given to the computer to produce a desired outcome. There's a fancy word we use for that: algorithm.

Are algorithms always on the computer? What are other examples?

A recipe is really a beautiful example of an algorithm, and it's a lot like code. You have a set of specialized terms, like "tablespoon" and "mince", and it involves all kinds of technological equipment.

How do you come up with a recipe?
- experimentation, trial-and-error
- cookbook
- family recipes
- remixing

That's exactly how I want you to think about code. You're always borrowing code, using libraries, looking stuff up, and it's lots and lots and lots of trial and error.

So where does that get us? What's possible with code? Here are some more or less random examples of artists making things with code:
- [Chris Milk](http://milk.co/treachery)
- [Nicole Aptekar](https://www.instagram.com/nicole.aptekar/)
- [Mario Klingemann](https://www.flickr.com/photos/quasimondo/albums/72157677689800878)
- [Brenna Murphy](https://upforgallery.com/central-lattice-tool-array)
- [Onyx Ashanti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JataQs4R5Bc&feature=youtu.be&t=1031)

What do you think about these examples?

How about this one?
- [Sol Lewitt](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnMOGrbPkAhWFlp4KHc0RA9gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1280&bih=677)

These are pieces by Sol Lewitt, who is a major figure in the so-called Western canon. But here's the thing. Sol didn't actually paint these. He just provided the [instructions](resources/lewitt.pdf).

Lewitt was doing this in the 60s. What else was happening in the 60s? The diffusion of computation into the cultural consciousness. This idea that we can make things happen in the world by defining them, formally, and letting the results play out.

So let's give it a shot.


## Exercise

- Take out the drawing you made
- Get an index card
- On the card I want you to write, in words, a series of instructions that, when followed by someone else, will result in the drawing
...
- Now we're going to swap
- When you're done, put the original, the code, and the re-interpretation together

Crit:
- Discuss the differences without revealing identities

Follow-up questions:
- How did it feel to follow the instructions?
- How much was left up to interpretation?


## Syllabus

There's three courses in Digital Media Art:
- This class focuses on learning to program and screen based graphics, the _formal_ elements of Digital Media
- The 200-level course gets away from the screen into 3d fabrication and sensing, and has a more _conceptual_ focus
- And finally the 300-level is independent research based
- We'll also have a separate Sound Art course running next spring

_Review syllabus_
- Here's what [p5 looks like](https://p5js.org/examples/form-regular-polygon.html)
- This is an art class: crit
- Dynamic syllabus
- The "textbook"
- My office and hours
- Bring laptops next class
- Will normally run until 11:20
