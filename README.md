## Course Description
Introduction to computer programming for artists. With creative coding, students will explore graphics and animation, sound, real-time video processing, the web, physical sensors, and augmented reality. Accompanying critical discussion will unpack historical and contemporary issues in digital media. Through practical and theoretical investigations, students will gain a foundation for working with digital form. No prior experience is required.

#### Objectives:
- Cultivate an ability to think abstractly in terms of algorithms
- Understand the broad historical context of contemporary digital tools
- Survey contemporary artists working formally with code and digital media
- Build a foundation for expanding into other areas of media art practice
- Gain proficiency programming in javascript with [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

## Assignments and Grading

### Sketches
This course is built around a progression of open-ended code "sketches" that progress through the use of text, images, animation, sound, video, and various forms of physical interaction. We will begin each one during class time, and you will (usually) complete them as homework. Starting with Week #4, you will post sketches online through your [GitHub](https://github.com) account. Sketches will be critiqued during class in small groups. 

Sketches cumulatively account for 90% of your final grade. In order to receive credit for your sketch, you must post a version of the code to your GitHub account and email me the link *before* the class that it is due. However, you may continue to make changes indefinitely and improve your grade if necessary. I will grade the sketches as follows:  
  
- *unsatisfactory* sketches fail to fulfill the basic requirements of the exercise  
- *satisfactory* sketches are functional and conceptually sound as expected  
- *exemplary* sketches show a level of refinement and/or experimentation beyond the basic requirements  

### Survey presentations
Each student will give a 10-minute presentations on an artist working in digital media. These presentations, which should be organized in slides, should give an overview of the context in which the artist is working and show one or two artworks in detail. Students should comment thoughtfully on how the work relates to themes discussed in class as well as to their own practices. Students will choose artists to present from an approved list on a first-come, first-served basis. These presentations make up 10% of your final grade.

### Reading
Each week we will read short primary texts in class that are important to the development of digital form. These will be provided in class.

In addition, it is recommended that you purchase [Getting Started with p5.js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Interactive-Graphics-JavaScript-Processing/dp/1457186772/) by Lauren McCarthy, Casey Reas, and Ben Fry for a general reference that will be helpful throughout the course.

### Attendance and participation
You must attend and thoughtfully participate in every class. An unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final grade by 5%. Excused absences must be discussed with me *prior* to the class to arrange for completing missed work. Being late twice will be treated as the equivalent of one absence. **Use of social media in class twice will also be treated as the equivalent of one absence.**


## Resources and Policies

### Syllabus
The version of this syllabus posted online will be updated periodically and is the definitive version. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Course Fee
There is a course fee automatically paid through student accounts when registered for this class. The fee helps cover software licensing and sensor hardware. However, open source software will be used whenever possible.

### Laptop Use
Work for this course should be done on a personal laptop—recent hardware and MacOS is preferred. If you do not have access to a laptop, email me and we will make arrangements for you to borrow a machine.

### Code Studio
All students must complete their own work but are encouraged to help each other. To facilitate collective learning, Fields 205 will be open for working on ART112 sketches and other code projects at the times posted above.

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. The work submitted in Digital Media courses must be conceived of and programmed by you. While learning from and incorporating code from other sources is a natural part of programming (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org)), you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not copy and paste others' code wholesale. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7156). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.
