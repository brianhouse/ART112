# Sketch #1: Still Life for Turtle

For this sketch, you will give instructions to a "[turtle](https://brianhouse.github.io/turtle5/)" who draws on the screen.

The turle understands instructions like these:
- `forward(100)`    Move forward 100 steps (can be abbreviated `fd`)
- `right(90)`     	Turn to the right 90ยบ (can be abbreviated `rt`)
- `left(90)`     	Turn to the left 90ยบ (can be abbreviated `lt`)
- `backwards(100)`  Move backwards 100 steps (can be abbreviated `bk`)
- `penup()`        	Pull the pen up off the paper (can be abbreviated `pu`)
- `pendown()`       Put the pen down on the paper (can be abbreviated `pd`)
- `repeat(4) {  
	fd 100 rt 90  
   }`				Repeat the instructions enclosed in brackets four times (makes a square)

To get the hang of things, have the turtle
- draw a square
- draw a triangle
- draw a circle (possible?)

\
Now have the turtle draw a still life from the model in the room.

Email your finished (or unfinished) code to the professor along with a screenshot of your result.
